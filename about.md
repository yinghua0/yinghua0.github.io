# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m **Ying-Hua Chung**, a bilingual engineer (Chinese & English) with a diverse background spanning telecom, computational chemistry, teaching, and now **Power Systems Engineering**.

<!--
## My Career Journey

After earning a Ph.D. in Chemistry with a focus on molecular simulation, I spent several years in academic research, developing software tools and running advanced computational models. I later pivoted to education, teaching high school math, physics, and college chemistry.

Today, Iâ€™m applying my analytical, simulation, and technical communication skills to the field of electric power systems. Iâ€™m especially interested in grid modeling, load flow analysis, and the tools that support clean and reliable energy systems.

## My Career Journey

From the start of my career, Iâ€™ve been driven by a curiosity for **how systems behave under constraints**, and how models and markets can balance efficiency with reliability.

In my MBA program, I focused on the telecommunications industry and completed a term project on ISP pricing models â€” analyzing how bandwidth constraints and peak-hour demand relate to floating pricing and bidding. This concept is directly related to **congestion pricing and bidding mechanisms** used in electricity markets today â€” where supply constraints shape the [market clearing price](./market-pricing.md).


After graduation, I worked as a **Market Planning Engineer** for a telecom manufacturer. There, I developed bid proposals for domestic tenders, aligning complex technical specifications with client requirements to secure procurement contracts. I also led the companyâ€™s debut at major global trade expos, coordinating cross-functional teams, marketing collateral, and international logistics.

I later earned a **Ph.D. in Chemistry** with a focus on **computational molecular simulation**, building advanced models and software tools to investigate molecular behaviors â€” an experience that deepened my expertise in quantitative analysis, algorithm design, and programming.

In the following years, I broadened my perspective through education, teaching high school math, physics, and college-level chemistry. This period strengthened my ability to communicate complex concepts to diverse audiences â€” a skill I value greatly in collaborative engineering and market design work.

Today, Iâ€™m applying this diverse background to **electric power systems** and wholesale energy markets. Iâ€™m especially interested in **grid modeling, load flow analysis, market design, and the algorithms that help balance system reliability with market efficiency**.
