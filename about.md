<!--
## My Career Journey

After earning a Ph.D. in Chemistry with a focus on molecular simulation, I spent several years in academic research, developing software tools and running advanced computational models. I later pivoted to education, teaching high school math, physics, and college chemistry.

Today, I’m applying my analytical, simulation, and technical communication skills to the field of electric power systems. I’m especially interested in grid modeling, load flow analysis, and the tools that support clean and reliable energy systems.

## My Career Journey

From the start of my career, I’ve been driven by a curiosity for **how systems behave under constraints**, and how models and markets can balance efficiency with reliability.

In my MBA program, I focused on the telecommunications industry and completed a term project on ISP pricing models — analyzing how bandwidth constraints and peak-hour demand relate to floating pricing and bidding. This concept is directly related to **congestion pricing in electricity markets** today.

After graduation, I worked as a **Market Planning Engineer** for a telecom manufacturer. There, I developed bid proposals for domestic tenders, aligning complex technical specifications with client requirements to secure procurement contracts. I also led the company’s debut at major global trade expos, coordinating cross-functional teams, marketing collateral, and international logistics.

I later earned a **Ph.D. in Chemistry** with a focus on **computational molecular simulation**, building advanced models and software tools to investigate molecular behaviors — an experience that deepened my expertise in quantitative analysis, algorithm design, and programming.

In the following years, I broadened my perspective through education, teaching high school math, physics, and college-level chemistry. This period strengthened my ability to communicate complex concepts to diverse audiences — a skill I value greatly in collaborative engineering and market design work.

Today, I’m applying this diverse background to **electric power systems** and wholesale energy markets. I’m especially interested in **grid modeling, load flow analysis, market design, and the algorithms that help balance system reliability with market efficiency**.
