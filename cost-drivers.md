# ⚡ Cost Analysis & Market Price Drivers

As we now have a big-picture view of how **bidding and pricing** work in wholesale power markets, let’s take a closer look at **what shapes a generator’s bid price** — and how that affects the overall market clearing price.

In a deregulated wholesale electricity market, the supply curve comes from stacking bids in **merit order**, from lowest to highest cost. These bids are based on each generator’s cost structure.

## 💰 Key Cost Components

A generator’s **total cost** can be broken down into:

- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)**: The upfront investment cost to build the power plant, typically shown as **\$/kW installed capacity**.  
- **OpEx (Operating Expenditure)**: Ongoing costs to run the plant — staffing, maintenance, insurance, etc.
- **Fuel Costs**: For fossil fuel generators, this is usually the largest variable cost.
- **Decommissioning Costs (Decomm)**: The estimated cost to safely retire and dismantle the plant at end of life. This must be planned for in the full cost calculation.

## 🔢 **Calculating Actual Energy Production**

Annual energy output depends on the installed capacity and the **capacity factor**, which accounts for planned and unplanned downtime.

> Annual MWh produced = Capacity (MW) × Capacity Factor × 8,760 hours/year


> ✅ Example:  
> A 100 MW wind farm with a capacity factor of 35%:  
> 100 MW × 0.35 × 8,760 = **~306,600 MWh/year**

## 📊 **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)**

The **LCOE** is the average cost per MWh of electricity generated over a plant’s lifetime, considering all costs.

**Basic formula:**
> LCOE = (CapEx + OpEx + Fuel + Decommissioning) / Total MWh produced

It’s a key metric for comparing different generation technologies:  
✅ Nuclear has high CapEx, low fuel cost.  
✅ Natural gas has moderate CapEx, higher fuel costs.  
✅ Solar/wind have high CapEx, zero fuel costs.

## 🔁 **Levelized Avoided Cost of Energy (LACE)**

While LCOE looks at **supply cost**, **LACE** measures the **value of displaced generation** — in other words, how much the grid saves when using your generator instead of alternatives.

If **LACE > LCOE**, the project is generally considered economically attractive.

## 🔍 **Market Participant Perspectives**

Different market players have different priorities:

- **Generators (Suppliers)**  
  Aim to cover all costs (CapEx, OpEx, fuel) and earn profit. In a uniform price auction, low-cost generators benefit by earning the marginal clearing price, creating **producer surplus**.

- **Load-Serving Entities (Buyers)**  
  Focus on securing reliable, affordable electricity. Their bid is shaped by forecasted demand, risk tolerance, and contract hedging.

- **Consumers**  
  Ultimately pay the costs passed through by load-serving entities. Large industrial users may participate directly.

- **Regulators / ISOs / RTOs**  
  Ensure fair market operations, reliable dispatch, and system stability while balancing cost, sustainability, and public interest.

## 📚 **Putting It All Together**

Understanding how each cost driver influences bids helps you interpret the **supply curve** and **market clearing price**.  
For example:
- Higher fuel prices → higher bids for gas generators → shifts the supply curve left → raises the clearing price.
- Lower LCOE renewables → more low-cost supply → pushes marginal generators off the curve → lowers prices.

---

## 🗂️ **Next Steps (Future Work)**

- Visualize real LCOE comparisons for different generation types.
- Explore case studies where changing fuel prices or policy incentives shifted market prices.
- Link to example merit order curves showing the impact of new renewables.
