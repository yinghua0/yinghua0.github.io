# ⚙️ Selected Projects

Welcome! Here are a few highlights of my current and recent work related to **Power Systems Engineering**, modeling, and simulation.

## 🔌 IEEE 14-Bus Load Flow Simulation (In Progress)

**Description:**  
I’m building a Python-based power flow model of the standard IEEE 14-bus test case using **PyPSA** (Python for Power System Analysis).  
- Load flow calculation (steady state)  
- Bus voltages, line loading, power generation balance  
- Results validation with open-source data

**Tools:** PyPSA, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

📂 _Source code will be shared on GitHub once the core results are validated._  
_(You could link to your repo here later: [View code →](https://github.com/yourusername/14bus-loadflow))_

## 📚 Electric Power Systems – Online Lecture Series

**Description:**  
Completed a structured, self-directed online course covering:  
- Power flow (load flow) analysis  
- Short circuit studies  
- Basic protection and control concepts

**Skills Practiced:**  
- Solving the Newton-Raphson load flow method by hand and in Python  
- Understanding the role of control systems in grid operation

## 📝 Additional Experience (Selected)

**Proposal Development & International Logistics:**  
Earlier in my career, I developed bid proposals for telecom tenders, coordinating technical specs and marketing materials for global trade expos (CeBIT Hannover, CommunicAsia). This work honed my cross-functional communication and documentation skills — still relevant when preparing technical reports for stakeholders.
